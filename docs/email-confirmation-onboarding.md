# Email Confirmation Onboarding

## Overview

The Email Confirmation Onboarding feature provides a user-friendly experience for users who need to verify their email address after registration. Instead of showing a simple error message, users are redirected to a dedicated onboarding page that guides them through the email confirmation process.

## Components

### EmailConfirmationOnboarding Component

Located at `src/components/auth/email-confirmation-onboarding.tsx`

**Features:**
- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Email display showing where the confirmation was sent
- Resend email functionality
- Helpful troubleshooting tips
- Beautiful, accessible UI design
- Loading states and error handling

**Props:**
```typescript
interface EmailConfirmationOnboardingProps {
  email?: string        // The email address where confirmation was sent
  redirectTo?: string   // Where to redirect after confirmation (optional)
}
```

## Pages

### Email Confirmation Page

Located at `src/app/auth/confirm-email/page.tsx`

**Route:** `/auth/confirm-email`

**Query Parameters:**
- `email` - The email address where confirmation was sent
- `redirectTo` - Where to redirect after successful confirmation

**Example URL:**
```
/auth/confirm-email?email=user@example.com&redirectTo=/app
```

## User Flow

1. **User Registration**
   - User fills out registration form
   - If email confirmation is required, they are redirected to `/auth/confirm-email`

2. **Email Confirmation Page**
   - Shows clear instructions on what to do
   - Displays the email address where confirmation was sent
   - Provides option to resend confirmation email
   - Shows helpful troubleshooting tips

3. **Email Confirmation**
   - User clicks link in email
   - Redirected to `/auth/callback` which handles the confirmation
   - On success, redirected to intended destination (usually `/app`)

## Integration

### Registration Form Update

The registration form (`src/components/auth/register-form.tsx`) has been updated to redirect to the email confirmation page instead of showing an error message:

```typescript
if (data.user) {
  if (!data.session) {
    // Redirect to email confirmation page
    router.push(`/auth/confirm-email?email=${encodeURIComponent(email)}&redirectTo=${encodeURIComponent(redirectTo)}`)
  } else {
    // Successful registration with immediate login
    router.push(redirectTo)
    router.refresh()
  }
}
```

### Auth Callback Enhancement

The auth callback route (`src/app/auth/callback/route.ts`) handles email confirmation and redirects users to their intended destination after successful verification.

## Testing

### Test Page

A test page is available at `/test/email-confirmation` to showcase the component in different states:

- With email address provided
- Without email address provided

### Manual Testing

1. **Register a new user** with email confirmation enabled
2. **Check that** you're redirected to `/auth/confirm-email`
3. **Verify** the email address is displayed correctly
4. **Test** the resend email functionality
5. **Check** the confirmation email and click the link
6. **Verify** successful redirect to the intended destination

## Accessibility Features

- **Keyboard navigation** supported throughout
- **Screen reader friendly** with proper ARIA labels
- **High contrast** colors for better visibility
- **Loading states** clearly indicated
- **Error messages** are descriptive and helpful

## Styling

The component uses the existing design system:
- Tailwind CSS classes
- Consistent with other auth components
- Responsive design
- Dark mode support
- Uses existing UI components (Button, Card, Alert, etc.)

## Security Considerations

- **Email validation** on resend functionality
- **Rate limiting** should be implemented on the resend endpoint
- **Secure redirects** using proper URL encoding
- **Session handling** is managed by Supabase Auth

## Future Enhancements

- **Email customization** - Allow custom email templates
- **Branding** - Add company logo and branding to the onboarding
- **Analytics** - Track email confirmation success rates
- **A/B testing** - Test different onboarding flows
- **Multi-language support** - Internationalization
