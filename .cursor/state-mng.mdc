# ðŸ“¦ Scalable State Management

- Use Zustand for cross-page or persistent UI state like:
  - selected tags
  - active filters
  - selected studio context
- Define stores in `lib/state/` with tight, focused slices.
- Use selectors (`useStore(state => state.selectedTags)`) to reduce re-renders.
- Avoid global state for SSR data or auth â€” use server components and context.
- Separate store logic from view logic â€” stores should contain no UI code.
