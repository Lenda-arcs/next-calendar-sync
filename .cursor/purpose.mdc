# 🌐 App Purpose: Yoga Schedule & Sharing Platform

This application is a web-based platform for **yoga teachers and movement instructors** to manage and share their **upcoming classes and events** through a beautifully designed, customizable schedule page.

## 🧘 Target Users
- Independent yoga teachers
- Movement professionals (Pilates, dance, fitness)
- Small studios or collectives

## 💡 Core Use Case
Teachers connect their personal calendar (via .ics feed or manual input). The system parses and displays their upcoming classes on a **shareable public page**, such as `/classes/[teacher-slug]`.

## 🔐 Authenticated Features
Teachers log in to manage:
- Their **personal profile** (bio, photo, social links)
- Their **event feed and parsed calendar events**
- Tags and images for class type auto-tagging
- Invoicing and request-based features

## 🚀 Public Schedule Page
The public page allows students to view:
- Upcoming classes (title, type, location, time)
- Filter by tags
- Get metadata like level, online/offline, and teacher contact

## 🛠 Technical Stack (assumed by agent)
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- Supabase (DB, Auth, Edge Functions)
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- React Server Components preferred
- Mobile-first UI design
- Reusable UI patterns (Card, PageSection, Container)

## ✨ Style & Feel
- Radial pastel gradient backgrounds
- Glassmorphism elements (semi-transparent cards)
- Calm, elegant serif + sans-serif typography (DM Serif Display + Outfit)

## 🧠 Agent Tips
- Respect the core user journey: connect calendar → manage content → share page
- Ensure session-protected logic only appears in `/app/*`
- UI should reflect lightness, flow, and simplicity — no bloat
