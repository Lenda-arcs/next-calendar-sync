# ðŸ§­ Routing Best Practices

- Dynamic public routes: use `app/[slug]/page.tsx` with `params.slug` fetching teacher data.
- Authenticated app routes live under `app/app/` (e.g., `/app/dashboard`).
- Always provide fallback pages (`notFound()` or loading) for dynamic content.
- Use `middleware.ts` for route protection and locale/session-based redirects.
- Avoid deeply nested route trees without shared layout context.
- Leverage `metadata` export in page components for SEO.
