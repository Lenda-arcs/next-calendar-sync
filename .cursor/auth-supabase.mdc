# üîê Supabase Auth & DB

- Use `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` and `createServerComponentClient()` in RSCs.
- In client components, use `createClientComponentClient()` when necessary.
- Use Supabase middleware to protect `/app/*` routes via `getSession()`.
- Do not pass session data manually through props.
- Fetch user data server-side to reduce client-side auth logic.
- Always enable and rely on RLS for row-level access control.
- Use `supabase gen types typescript` for strong typing.
