# ðŸ“¡ Data Fetching

- Use `createServerComponentClient()` for fetching data in RSCs.
- Prefer server data fetching to client-side unless absolutely required.
- Place all DB logic in `lib/queries/` or `lib/db.ts`.
- Co-locate query logic by feature: `queries/teachers.ts`, `queries/tags.ts`, etc.
- Use `revalidate` tags for incremental regeneration (`export const revalidate = 60`).
- Wrap queries in `try/catch` and handle missing data with `notFound()` or redirects.
