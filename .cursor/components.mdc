# ðŸ§© Component Design

- Dumb components (UI only) go into `components/ui/`.
- Smart components (data-aware) belong to `components/features/[domain]/`.
- Do not fetch data directly in UI components â€” pass via props or context.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling; avoid external CSS frameworks.
- Use Framer Motion or `@headlessui/react` for animations and modals.
- Reuse common card, button, input, and layout components.
